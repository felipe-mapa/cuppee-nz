# CUPPEE NZ

An e-commerce website to sell reusable coffee cups.

My partner asked me for a website to help sell her reusable cups. At that point I was studying PHP, so I decided to make the most of the project by building the website from scratch to learn how it works. I hard coded the admin panel, and used the server MySQL database, among other things.

## Reflections
- It was great to learn so many things in only one project and understand how a lot of things work behinf the scenes. However, I realised that for future projects it'd be better and faster to use some pre-coded features, for example an already established CMS and authentication instead of coding all by myself.

#### Payment

To handle payment I chose to use Stripe over other payment methods because it's easy to implement (it has got a great documentation and customer support), supports multiple payment methods, has got the lowest rates over a sell and it's pay-as-you-go (no additinal fees). 

#### Database

I used the host databse MySQL which I was already familiar with from university.

#### Email

I already knew how to send emails with PHP, but the challenge here was to send a personalized email (in a nice HTML template) to the customer after checkout was completed and an email to the store with the customer/order details. 

Of course there are many pre build email templates out there, but again, I wanted to know and understand how it works. So, after some reading and searching I learned how to create a template email with PHP.
